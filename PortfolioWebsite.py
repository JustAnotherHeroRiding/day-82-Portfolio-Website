#I will be using bootstrap again and start 
# working from a template

#Then finetune and create something of my own.

#Use the design rules and tips from day 65
#Change the fonts and colors from the template
#Pick a nice color scheme and font styles
#make the links work and add info to them as well

#Personalize and fill up every part of the page
#Use chatgpt and google for everything i feel i cant do

#Try to find a way to use Javascript and learn more about it
#See how other devs used JS for their personal websites

#Check out the designs from 
# https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/web-developer-portfolio
#and copy what looks cool


#NEXT STEPS
